# CodeBook for the Tidy Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This code book accompanies the tidy dataset created from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. The dataset was collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, capturing various activities performed by 30 subjects.

## Variables
The tidy dataset contains the following variables:

- `subject`: Integer. Identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- `activity`: Factor. Activity performed by the subject during measurements.
- `tBodyAcc-mean()-X`: Numeric. Mean body acceleration in the X direction.
- ... (include all other variables with a brief description)

## Transformations
The following transformations were applied to the original dataset:

1. Merged the training and the test sets.
2. Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Applied descriptive activity names.
4. Labeled the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second, tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

The variables were selected based on the presence of 'mean()' or 'std()' in their names.

## Data Summary
The resulting tidy dataset provides the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, creating a clear and easy-to-understand overview of the data.

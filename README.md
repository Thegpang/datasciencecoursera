# README for the Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` that processes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and creates a tidy dataset ready for analysis.

## Project Goals
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

## Files in the Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: The script for transforming the data.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, the data, and the transformations.
- `tidy_data_set.txt`: The final tidy dataset produced by the script.

## Script Execution
To run the script, source it in R: `source('run_analysis.R')`. The script will:

1. Merge the training and test datasets.
2. Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Use descriptive activity names.
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
